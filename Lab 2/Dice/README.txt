Dear student,
Sorry to have to do this to you but the previous student working 
on this project has been reassigned to another project 
(in the Riviera Maya -- go figure).

One of our customers reports that something is wrong. 
However, the student claims to have tested the DiceCounter class 
and he claims to have submitted a "tester" class as well. 
He said to just look at the documentation (he even used javadoc style comments).

We seem to have deleted the DiceCounter.java file by mistake but 
managed to salvage the byte code of the DiceCounter and the student's tester file.

Please submit a short report in D2L telling us
 - if there are any bugs in the DiceCounter
 - a better description of what the class DiceCounter does
 - a recommendation as to whether this class is appropriate 
   for simulating a dice game? 

Thanks.
