Implement a class Purse.
A purse contains a collection of coins.
The class Coin is provided for you (and documented as well)

Store the coins as an ArrayList of Coin in the class Purse.

Supply a constructor.

Fill the "missing code" in the public methods of Purse ... look at the
directoin "docs" for the documentation

   public void addCoin(Coin coin)

   public static boolean equalCoins(Coin a, Coin b)
      to compare the coins a and b based on their name and value

   public String toString()
      to return a string in the format
         Purse[(quarter,25), (dime,10), (nickel,5), (dime,10)]
   
   public int occurrences(Coin coin)
      to count the number of occurrences of "coin" in the purse

   public boolean sameCoins(Purse other)
      remembering that the parameter "other" could be null
      to compare all the coins in the purse with all the coins in the other purse
      to determine if the coins are the same
      MUST use the method "occurrences"

   public boolean otherSameCoins(Purse other) 
      remembering that other could be possibly be null
      another version to compare all the coins in the purse 
      with all the coins in the other purse to determine if the coins are the same
      this version must not use the method "occurrences"

   public int getHighestCoinValue()
     the highest value of any coin in the purse, e.g. 25 

   public boolean removeCoin(Coin coin)
      if there is coin in the purse that is the same as the coin passed as argument
      remove that coin from the purse

Read under docs the description to the methods of Purse.

Method of ArrayList you might not know about are "indexOf"
and we did mention "remove" in class yesterday.
They require equals to be correctly defined in Coin but that has been
done for you.

Test that your class Purse is correct with the PurseTester.java: 
a possible resulting session (log) is in session.txt

Add more tests as necessary.

To submit by 10:20 your Purse.java and your PurseTester.java
